# Distributive Law

#Input
# There will be three lines of input. 
# The first line has the value for A, the second for B, and the third for C. All values will be positive integers.
# 11
# 5
# 4
# Output
# The program must print three lines demonstrating the Distributive Law with the input values. 
# The first line must substitute the values into the equation. 
# The second line must show the result of the first level of evaluation. 
# The third line must show the result of the final evaluation. Follow the pattern shown below.
# 11 * (5 + 4) = 11 * 5 + 11 * 4
# 11 * 9 = 55 + 44 
# 99 = 99
